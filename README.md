# Clustering Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **clustering** projects that I have developed to explore various aspects of **unsupervised learning**. Each project demonstrates different clustering techniques, methodologies, and datasets, showcasing my skills in data analysis and machine learning.

## Purpose
The primary intention of this repository is to:
- Provide a comprehensive understanding of clustering analysis.
- Highlight the application of various clustering algorithms to discover patterns and groupings in data.
- Share insights and methodologies that can be beneficial for learning and reference in unsupervised learning scenarios.
- Hopefully receiving feedback from others especially in unsupervised learning projects to enhance my understanding.

## Projects Included

### Project 1: [Clustering Project 1]
**Description**: A project exploring how to cluster data points into meaningful groups using techniques like **K-means**.
  
**Techniques Used**:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, etc.
  - **Clustering Algorithm**: K-means or DBSCAN, including hyperparameter tuning.
  - **Evaluation Metrics**: Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, etc.
  - **Visualization**: Plotting clusters and cluster centroids for better interpretability.




## Conclusion
Through these projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of clustering analysis and its applications in **unsupervised learning**. I hope this repository serves as a useful resource for anyone interested in learning more about clustering techniques, their practical implementations, and how they can reveal hidden patterns in complex datasets.
